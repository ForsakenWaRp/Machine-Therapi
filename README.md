Internal Hacking Framework

It will always be neat when starting a new project. And while continuing this project, things get complicated. At least that was the case for me.
After realizing this, I thought why not write a framework. So I could start regularly and continue regularly. I learned the framework concept while dealing with javascript and php. I had coded php framework before.

My MVC OPP framework:
(https://github.com/chmod777-R/karmate)
My functional programming framework:
(https://github.com/chmod777-R/happyMVC)

I wanted to do this for my internal works with c ++ too and I got to work today. When I got a little bit of something, I wanted to post this here because I wanted to help people who are just starting internal hacking.

I will try to post updates regularly.

What am I waiting for?

Known bypass methods
Functional memory functions
Interface and development equipment
String, vector and etc. functional functions on topics.
